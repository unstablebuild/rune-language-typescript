# Validate that HEAD carries a release tag the in-product upgrader will
# accept, before any expensive build work runs. Invoked as the first
# prerequisite of the dist-* make targets.
#
# Rules (kept in sync with the ide upgrade manager):
#   - version must match canonical semver ("vMAJOR[.MINOR[.PATCH]][-pre][+build]")
#     as accepted by golang.org/x/mod/semver.
#   - no dirty/distance suffix from `git describe` (-dirty, -<N>-g<sha>):
#     those parse as pre-release labels and compare in surprising ways.
#
# NOTE: the javascript, tsx and typescript packages supersede the grammar-only
# ones rune-language-template published (latest v0.0.9-1-g58ab44c). An upload
# moves a package's latest pointer whatever its version, and Rune offers any
# latest that differs from the installed one, so ordering is not enforced. Keep
# these tags above every version published for the three packages and off the
# template's own v0.0.x line (it has tagged up to v0.0.13): start at v0.1.0.
